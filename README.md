We introduce a novel method, DiffPhyCon, for controlling complex physical systems using generative models, by minimizing the learned generative energy function and specified control objectives. Further, we enhance DiffPhyCon with prior reweighting, enabling the discovery of control sequences that significantly deviate from the training distribution.

# Installation

Run the following commonds to install dependencies. In particular, when run the smoke control task, the python version must be 3.8 due to the requirement of the Phiflow software.

```code
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate DiffPhyCon
```

# Dataset and checkpoints
## Dataset
The checkpoints of both our DiffPhyCon and baselines on the three tasks (1D Burgers', 2D jellyfish, 2D smoke), and our released Jellyfish datasets can be downloaded in [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_ECmMZ77Lm02znhQ72MvwKe1MqGQquzU). 

## Dataset Generation
To generate dataset for the three tasks by yourself, please run the following files:
- 1D Burger's: dataset/apps/generate_burgers.py 
- 2D jellyfish: dataset/apps/generate_jellyfish/LilyPad/LilyPad.pde. Please replace the variable *root_dir* in this file with your local path. To run this file, you need to download and install [Processing](https://processing.org/). For more details on how to run lily-pad files, please refer to its [official repo](https://github.com/weymouth/lily-pad).
- 2D Smoke: dataset/apps/a_gen_dataset_128.py. For its running environment, please refer to the **Environment** section in the README.md file of our another paper: [WDNO](https://github.com/AI4Science-WestlakeU/wdno). 


To run the following training and inference scripts locally, replace the path names in filepath.py by your local paths.
<!-- Because the training dataset in the 2D experiment is over 100GB, it is not contained in this link. -->


# Training:
## 1D Burgers' Equation Control:

### Surrogate model
```code
python /model/pde_1d_surrogate_model/burgers_operator.py --date_time "2024-01-09_1d_surrogate_partial_ob_partial_ctr_autoregress-3" --epochs 500 --gpu 0 --train_batch_size 151 --autoregress_steps 3 --dataset_path "/dataset_control_burgers/free_u_f_1e5_front_rear_quarter" --is_partially_observable 1 --is_partially_controllable 1 --lr 0.001
```

### DiffPhyCon

In the diffusion_1d folder, run
```code
bash script/train_pw_XOXC.sh
bash script/train_XOXC.sh
```
where XOXC stands for one of the setting names: FOPC, POFC, and POPC.


## 2D Jellyfish Control:

### DiffPhyCon

In the scrpits/ folder, for the full observation scenario, run the following script to train a diffusion model for joint distribution of the state trajectory and control signals:
```
bash jellyfish_train_joint_full.sh
```

run the following script to train an additional diffusion model for the control signels prior:
```
bash jellyfish_train_w_full.sh
```
Similarly, for the partial observation scenario, run the following two scripts, respectively:
```
bash jellyfish_train_joint_partial.sh
bash jellyfish_train_w_partial.sh
```


## 2D Smoke Control:

### DiffPhyCon

In the scrpits/ folder, run the following script to train a diffusion model for joint distribution of the state trajectory and control signals:
```
bash smoke_train_joint.sh
```

run the following script to train an additional diffusion model for the control signels prior:
```
bash smoke_train_w.sh
```

# Inference:
## 1D Burgers' Equation Control:


### DiffPhyCon

In the diffusion_1d folder, run
```code
bash script/eval_XOXC.sh
```
where XOXC stands for one of the setting names: FOPC, POFC, and POPC.


## 2D Jellyfish Control:
### DiffPhyCon
In the scripts/ folder, for the full/partial observation scenarios, run the following two scripts, repectively:
```
bash jellyfish_inference_full.sh
bash jellyfish_inference_partiall.sh
```


## 2D Smoke Control:
### DiffPhyCon
In the scripts/ folder, run the following script:
```
bash smoke_inference.sh
```
